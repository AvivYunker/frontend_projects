// variable - a container for data. a named representation of a place in the RAM memory

// conventions for naming variables:
// should never start with a digit
// should never contain spaces
// should never contain special characters (except for dollar signs, they're ok)
// recommended naming convention: camel casing (thisIsAVariable, variableNumberOne)
// we should give meaningful names to variable ("weight1" instead of "w1")
